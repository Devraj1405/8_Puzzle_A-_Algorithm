# 8_Puzzle_A-_Algorithm
Here in my class of INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS, I have implemented the 8 puzzle problem using the A* algorithm. Any state can be entered as the initial state and goal state can be defined by the user. It will give the output and print the number of nodes explored, expanded and number of steps it took to reach the output along with printing the moves for each step.

It was fun coding this and trying different initial and goal states to see the outcome.
